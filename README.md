# GPT3-based conflict resolution chat bot
This is the code I used to create a small private SMS text chat system that employs GP3 from OpenAI and  "nonviolent communication", an algorithmically based method of conflict resolution. Hopefully the chat helps users process conflict. 

For an AWESOME introduction to nonviolent communication, see https://github.com/cognitivetech/Marshall-Rosenberg-NVC

If you find this code useful, why not buy me a chai at https://ko-fi.com/renay.
